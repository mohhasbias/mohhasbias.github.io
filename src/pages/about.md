I'm a computer engineer that became passionate about web development and information system. I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others.

In pursue of my passion, I've participating in many programming challenges including [TopCoder](http://topcoder.com/members/mohhasbias). I've participating in various tech stack, including angular, react, and recently [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/). Open source fills my love of programming. Lots of great source code examples in the open source community that I can learn from.

I also love to program everything that I can which is now becoming a field called Robotic Process Automation. I'm also a tech enthusiast and love to learn about new technologies, including Kafka, Redis, and Grafana. I love software development from planning to deployment, and I'm also a big fan of DevOps. I'm also a big fan of transparent progress as encouraged by Agile and Scrum.

Currently, I'm studying at [King Abdulaziz University](https://www.kau.edu.sa/Home.aspx?lng=en) in Saudi Arabia. I'm pursuing Doctoral Degree in Computer Information System in Faculty of Computer and Information Technology.

Basically, I'm a tech enthusiast, programming lover, and competitive programmer passionate about building scalable solutions and teaching others. Let's learn and code together!
