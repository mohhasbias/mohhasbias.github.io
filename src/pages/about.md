I'm a computer engineer that became passionate about web development and information system. I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others.

In pursue of my passion, I've participating in many programming challenges including TopCoder. I've participating in various tech stack, including angular, react, and recently [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/). Open source fills my love of programming. Lots of great source code examples in the open source community that I can learn from.

I also love to program everything that I can which is now becoming a field called Robotic Process Automation. I'm also a tech enthusiast and love to learn about new technologies, including Kafka, Redis, and Grafana. I love software development from planning to deployment, and I'm also a big fan of DevOps. I'm also a big fan of transparent progress as encouraged by Agile and Scrum.

Basically, I'm a tech enthusiast, programming lover, and competitive programmer passionate about building scalable solutions and teaching others. Let's learn and code together!
