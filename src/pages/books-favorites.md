I love reading books. I read books about programming, self-development, and many more. Here are some of my favorite books:

## Programming

- Structured Programming in C

  I forgot the exact title of this book, but I remember that it's about structured programming in C. I also forgot the authors name. I read this book when I was in the first semester of bachelor degree in the university. It's a very good book to learn about structured programming. It's also the first book that I read about programming. It teach programming as an analogy to writing a formal letter with a header, body, and footer. It is a fascinating analogy that I still remember until now.

- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/0471469831) by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser

  This is the first book that I read about data structures and algorithms. It's a very good book to learn about data structures and algorithms. It has plenty of examples and exercises. It has a short and pretty straightforward explanation. It's a very hands-on book. I really like it.

- [Data Structures and Algorithms in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/0471202088) by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and David M. Mount

  This is a book with the same title and the same authors about data structures and algorithms. Having these two books, it really helps me to differentiate between concepts and syntax. And the books really looks alike, it only differs in code examples.

- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert C. Martin

  This is a book that I read because so many people talks about it. But I find it confusing until now. Because something that stated here is already encapsulated as a framework, for example, Ruby on Rails. I think this book is more suitable for people who write code from scratch, not using a framework.
