## What is Information Visualization?

Information Visualization is the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines computer science, statistics, cognitive science, and graphic design. It is also known as data visualization, information design, and information architecture.

## Why is Information Visualization important?

Information Visualization is important because it helps people understand data more easily. It is also important because it helps people make better decisions.

Human beings are visual creatures. We process visual information much faster than text or numbers. We can process visual information in parallel, while we can only process text or numbers in serial. We can also process visual information in a more intuitive way than text or numbers.
